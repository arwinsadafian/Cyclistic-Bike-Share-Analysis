DATA SOURCE
------------------------------------------------------------
Source:         Divvy Bike-Share System (Chicago)
Period:         January 2019 - March 2020 (15 months)
Raw Files:      5 quarterly CSV files
Raw Records:    4,244,891

CLEANING PIPELINE
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Schema Harmonization
  - Unified 3 different data formats across quarters
  - Standardized column names and data types

Step 2: Duration Filtering (STRICT Approach)
  - Removed rides < 60 seconds (false starts/redocks)
  - Removed rides > 24 hours (lost/stolen bikes)
  - Removed missing/invalid duration values

Step 3: Age Data Quality
  - Removed 234 suspicious records (birth year 1921 cluster)
  - Retained legitimate senior riders (70-89 years)

Step 4: Validation
  - Dual-approach comparison (STRICT vs LENIENT)
  - Both approaches yielded identical 8.9:1 ratio
