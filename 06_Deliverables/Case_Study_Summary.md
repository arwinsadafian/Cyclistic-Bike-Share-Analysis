# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study
## Converting Casual Riders to Annual Members

---

### The Challenge

Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-share company, wanted to understand how annual members and casual riders use their service differently. The goal: design data-driven marketing strategies to convert casual riders into profitable annual members.

### My Approach

I conducted a comprehensive analysis using **five different tools** to demonstrate versatility and ensure robust findings:

**Data Processing & Cleaning (Python)**
- Processed 4.2M ride records across 5 quarterly datasets
- Harmonized 3 different data schemas into a unified format
- Applied rigorous quality checks, reducing to 2.9M validated records
- Used dual-approach validation to confirm findings weren't artifacts of cleaning choices

**Database Analysis (SQL)**
- Built MySQL database for efficient querying
- Wrote complex aggregations to identify usage patterns
- Validated findings against Excel pivot tables

**Statistical Analysis (R)**
- Performed t-tests confirming behavioral differences (p < 0.001)
- Created publication-quality ggplot2 visualizations

**Interactive Visualization (Tableau)**
- Built interactive dashboard for stakeholder exploration
- Enabled drill-down by time period, user type, and station

**Executive Presentation (PowerPoint)**
- Created 12-slide presentation with embedded charts
- Translated technical findings into business recommendations

### Key Findings

| Insight | Members | Casual | Implication |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Avg Ride Duration | 8.8 min | 15.1 min | Casual = leisure; Member = commute |
| Peak Days | Tue-Thu | Sat-Sun | Different use cases |
| Peak Hours | 8 AM, 5 PM | 3-6 PM | Commuter vs recreational |
| Seasonal Variation | Moderate | Extreme | Summer = conversion opportunity |

**The big insight:** Casual riders aren't occasional users — they're *engaged* users who ride longer. They just use bikes differently.

### Recommendations

1. **Weekend Warrior Campaign** - Target the 60% of casual rides happening on weekends with a "Weekend Plus" membership tier

2. **Summer Surge Initiative** - Concentrate marketing spend in Q2-Q3 when casual engagement peaks (4.4× higher than winter)

3. **Commuter Conversion Program** - Target afternoon casual riders with "Ride to Work" messaging showing $1,200 annual transit savings vs $180 membership

### Projected Impact

- **29,500** new member conversions (Year 1)
- **$4.1M** net revenue (Year 1)
- **342%** ROI on marketing investment
- **$21.8M** cumulative revenue over 3 years
